# Bytex Hackathon 2022 üíª

This is a minimalist social media platform that focuses on bringing friends together in real life, creating awesome memories and finding new places. We've developed this application during FiiPractic Challenge 2022, an 24h hackathon hosted by [Bytex](https://bytex.net) and [ASII](https://www.asii.ro/), where our [team](#-team-c12) took first place.

## Main Concept

Our platform's main goal is to connect people in real life by providing an easy way to send invitations to hang out, paired with an awesome rewards system.  
The process is very easy, you can send an invitation to multiple accounts containing the event name, location and estimate hour. When the group will meet in real life at the specified location, every participant will get an number of points based on various factors. With those points the users can access private events or different promotions from our sponsors.  
Our application also has an feed where you can see your friends last hangouts and a memories section where you can store your events history.
